    "This project takes inspiration from the action/adventure game Star Wars Fallen Order in order to customize a character in the Star Wars universe. Along with a character customization, the user also gets to customize a lightsaber and a droid companion.\n",
    "\n",
    "I drew inspiration from this video game because of my recent interest in its existence. One of my favorite parts about the game was customizing a lightsaber, so I, essentially, took the descriptions of the different lightsabers presented in the game and applied them here. It also influenced the droid companion as the main character in the game has a droid partner for the majority of the run time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When selecting a character, the user will be prompted to choose either the \"light side\" or \"dark side\" as both are definitive good vs bad guy sides in the Star Wars universe. They will also be asked to type in a name, and that name will be stored to the side that they select. For example, if I chose the \"dark side\" and typed \"Jacob\", the code would save \"Darth Jacob\" as it is a stereotypical bad guy name in this fandom.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program displays multiple options for each selection, so if the user was prompted to choose a lightsaber color, they would be shown a menu of lightsaber colors to select from. Each selection will be stored as their customization for a lightsaber. The same goes with making the emitter and type of saber. \n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to designing a droid buddy, I thought it would simple to just list the droids and ask which one the user wants. I thought about making this optional, but realized that droids are really cool and everyone should have one as an adventure companion if they're existing in this universe!"

    "Each time the user is offerred a decision, they will be given a menu with multiple options to choose from (i.e., a) red, b) blue, etc..). To proceed throughout the code, the user should select the option provided in variable form. For instance, if the user wanted to select the red option from the previous example, the command would be 'a' or 'A' instead of 'red' or 'Red'. That way there is less room for error in mispelling, and it flows more like a multiple choice test.\n",
